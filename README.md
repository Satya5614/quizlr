**1. How long did it take to complete the assessment? (minutes)**

It took me roughly 8hours(480 minutes) to complete the task in scope.

**3. Does the cross-platform framework that you chose have access to native OS functions?**

I used react native and it has access to native OS functions.

React Native uses a bridge to communicate between JS and the underlying native platform, which allows it to access and use any native functionality provided by the platform.

**4. Do you have any feedback for us regarding the assessment?**

I think the expected time i.e 3.5h is less to compete assessment effectively.

Overall I loved the designs of the app and enjoyed developing the UI, I fond some inconsistencies in the design elements, like consistent padding, colors and font sizes for test elements etc.
